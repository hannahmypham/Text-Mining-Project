team manager, then tottenham hotspur might just have made its point against manchester united on sunday.the game was cast as high noon at white hart lane .the british news media and the bookmakers had concocted their usual seasonal head hunt of premier league managers and coaches in time for christmas.one betting company, william hill, forecast that spurs manager andr\\u00e9 villas-boas would \\\"be gone by midnight on sunday.\\\"it is a game of casual brutality. the coaches are given survival odds similar to turkeys' at this time of year.and bookmakers who complain about illegal betting and attempts to fix matches have their own league table of the doomed coaches.before spurs held united to a tenacious and well-deserved 2-2 draw, the shortest odds in this very odd game held that villas-boas, then fulham manager martin jol and norwich city's chris hughton were the men targeted by the public's bets. fulham's new owner, shahid khan, did dismiss jol on sunday night, but others are holding their fire.\\\"the team's response today was good,\\\" villas-boas said on television moments after the final whistle .\\\"i am extremely happy with the response of the players after the setback against manchester city,\\\" he said, referring to the 6-0 capitulation of his team in manchester the previous weekend.\\\"there is obviously an agenda; it's pretty clear,\\\" villas-boas continued. \\\"but the players showed strength of character, great team spirit, and with a not bad result against the premier league champion, they deserve respect.\\\"yes, they do.respect, and perhaps a period of patience and understanding from the tottenham board, which authorized the sale three months ago of the team's star, gareth bale, and spent 110 million pounds, or $180 million, on seven new players, all from other countries and none with any experience in the english league .whether villas-boas, or spurs' new technical director, the italian franco baldini, is principally responsible for choosing those imported players is not clear.but it is villas-boas who must integrate them into a team capable of at least finishing in the top four places in england, thus qualifying for the holy grail of the champions league .so far, so uncertain.before the collapse at city, spurs had looked solid but unexciting. tottenham fans demand more. their motto is glory, glory.they expect soccer with a swagger; they accept defeat provided it comes in an adventurous way. villas-boas is a careful student of coaching theory, and a cautious man in terms of setting up a team first and foremost to be hard to defeat.his predecessor, harry redknapp, was the opposite, a swashbuckling coach, a man whose forte was instinct and who dared to risk everything on an attacking game.led in the attack by wayne rooney, who scored his team's goals, one from the penalty spot, united arrived unbeaten in 11 matches, and with a 5-0 away victory over bayer leverkusen fresh in the memory. spurs took the lead after 18 minutes when paulinho, one of their brazilians, won a free kick just outside the penalty box . kyle walker fired a fierce low shot straight at the defensive wall supposedly protecting the goalkeeper. to a man, everyone in that line jumped, and the shot passed beneath them into the goal.walker, though, was guilty of a hapless error in handing the initiative back to united a quarter of an hour later.he allowed a swinging cross from phil jones to bounce off his shin, and rooney was in like a piranha to reach the ball ahead of sandro 6 yards out. that was rooney's 163rd goal in the premier league, tying him with robbie fowler for fifth in league history.but spurs wrested the initiative back early in the second half when sandro struck a shot from 20 yards that was beautiful in its violence .the ball rose off his right foot, swerved in midair and curled inside the far top corner of the net at a pace such that no goalkeeper could have intercepted it.now would tottenham consolidate its advantage? could it hold on for its first victory over united in london since?not even for five minutes. spurs goalie hugo lloris, who sustained a concussion during a home game last month, made a rash error of judgment, diving to grab the leg of united's danny welbeck as he strode through.a definite penalty kick, and one that rooney smacked with uncompromising force straight down the center of the goal.that, for all the efforts of both sides and for all the intrigue, was the final swing of the pendulum. the draw was just, and spurs' walker made a promise:\\\"we've bought a lot of players, good players,\\\" he said, adding: \\\"it might take a bit of time, but i've every faith in the players and the gaffer. we'll be up there at the finish, i guarantee it.\\\"all bets are off, then.\",\n          \"the argentine soccer club san lorenzo completed a stunning revival sunday night, clinching its first title since 2007 and prompting some to speculate about divine intervention.eighteen months ago, san lorenzo, one of argentina's big five soccer teams, was on the brink of relegation to the second division. it kept its hopes alive on the final day of the season before winning a playoff to remain in the top tier .this year has been much better. the club's most prominent supporter \\u2014 a catholic cardinal named jorge mario bergoglio \\u2014 became pope francis in march. pope francis is a lifelong fan of the club, which was founded by a priest more than a century ago, and used to attend matches as a boy. in august, the club made pope francis an honorary member.on sunday night, san lorenzo played a scoreless draw with v\\u00e9lez sarsfield to win the first half of the 2013-14 argentine season, called the torneo inicial, by 2 points.\\\"what joy!\\\" exclaimed the pope on hearing the news, according to news media reports in italy. san lorenzo has undergone a minor revolution since september, when mat\\u00edas lammens took charge as the team president. he addressed the club's poor finances and embarked on a successful membership drive. a municipal law was passed allowing the club to return to the site of its original stadium, a longstanding dream of the fans and a move that francis reportedly favored.lammens also appointed juan antonio pizzi as the coach. pizzi guided san lorenzo to its 12th domestic league title, though the most devoted fans will no doubt claim he had a helping hand.\",\n          \"palermo, sicily \\u2014 roberta vinci beat top-seeded fellow italian sara errani, 3-6, 6-3 on sunday to win the italiacom open for the first time.the second-seeded vinci was broken in the first game, but she broke back twice before serving out the opening set . errani, who won this tournament in 2008 and, raced into a 5-1 lead in the second set.but vinci went ahead 4-0 in the final set and then held off the sixth-ranked errani's comeback attempt to secure her ninth career victory.the win also ends a streak of five straight victories for errani over her close friend and doubles partner.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n
